1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,213
- All I was doing was just
waking up, making breakfast,

2
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:25,171
going down to Starbucks,
buying my $6 latte or whatever,

3
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,010
do my work at Starbucks,

4
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,888
going home and going to bed.

5
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:31,324
I was just thinking my lease is coming up

6
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:36,289
and I’m going to have to pay
$6,000(Singapore Dollar) to keep doing this

7
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,128
and I just thought, “Screw it.

8
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:40,943
"Let’s just leave.

9
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:42,854
"I don’t need to be here.

10
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:44,050
"Let’s just leave.”

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,967
- It’s absolute project impossible.

12
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:50,431
I couldn’t do it because I
knew that it would make me

13
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,529
so damn unhappy that I would do everything

14
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:54,779
in my power to not go back.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,297
I couldn’t imagine going back to that.

16
00:00:57,297 --> 00:00:58,338
That would be crazy.

17
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:00,618
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,323
- Once something becomes
your comfort zone,

19
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:05,687
it’s time to leave because

20
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:08,208
that keeps you constantly expanding.

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,927
You expand yourself,
definition of who you are.

22
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:13,161
You expand the places of
where you become comfortable

23
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:16,216
in the world.

24
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,639
- Our commute to work.

25
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,806
We always wanted to travel for
years, like super long term.

26
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,287
- 100.

27
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:49,452
- Okay, okay, I give you 120.

28
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,046
- We were living in the Silicon Valley.

29
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,140
Most people are trying to
get into the Silicon Valley

30
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,698
and we grew up there, so
we were trying to get out.

31
00:02:57,698 --> 00:03:00,428
It started out, I asked my boss.

32
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:03,547
We already, at Upwork,
we have one day a week

33
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:06,182
that everybody in the
entire company is remote.

34
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:10,147
You can work from home, and so
I negotiated two days a week.

35
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:12,753
And slowly, the two days a
week became three, became four,

36
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:15,243
became five and then one point I think,

37
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:18,934
I said as a joke to my
boss at the time that

38
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,601
"Maybe I can work while I'm traveling."

39
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,224
Surprisingly, she was super supportive

40
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:26,891
and one year later, here we are.

41
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:40,882
- So the digital nomad
thing is really different

42
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:44,603
from the traveler who's
just here having fun.

43
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:47,948
They'll be here this weekend, maybe a week

44
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:50,025
and then they're gone
and on to the next place.

45
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:52,525
It's two very different lives.

46
00:03:56,985 --> 00:04:00,744
- The biggest challenge though
is dealing with time zones.

47
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:04,661
It's difficult to overlap
from Asia with Europe

48
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,583
and the United States.

49
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:11,344
It means we end up working
really crazy hours.

50
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:14,982
We usually start working
around like 5 or 6 p.m.

51
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:18,238
and work until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.

52
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,810
When we were in Bali, it was way worse.

53
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,019
I was working till 4am and .

54
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,577
- 5 a.m., 6 a.m.
- Some, yeah.

55
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:32,073
- We started traveling two
months after we got married

56
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:35,313
and one of our friends
who we met traveling,

57
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:38,563
he called us the ultimate honeymooners.

58
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,782
We're kind of on a never ending honeymoon.

59
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:46,040
That definitely has its.

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,540
- That explains all the problems we have.

61
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:04,162
- I'm an engineer, and basically what I do

62
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:07,245
is I run two different SaaS services.

63
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,205
Singapore was where I had
my last corporate job ever.

64
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:14,426
I didn't want to keep building
stuff for other people,

65
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,445
I wanted to build something for myself.

66
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:20,612
Then it got closer and closer
to my lease coming to an end.

67
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:25,539
And I was just looking at
my life up until that point.

68
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:27,208
If I find a cheap place,
how much is it going

69
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,005
to cost for me to stay there for a month?

70
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,596
I started looking on Agoda and I was like,

71
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,464
"Oh my God, I can stay
in a hotel for $1,000,

72
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:37,036
"which is 3 times less than my rent."

73
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,622
Why has it taken me this long to realize

74
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,385
that actually I could
be doing all this work

75
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:44,015
from Thailand or anywhere.

76
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,051
It's just kind of this epiphany moment

77
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:51,048
and I guess it all seems
really obvious in retrospect.

78
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:54,758
Ever since that point,
that was 2012 August,

79
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:58,425
I haven't stopped.

80
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,588
- Being a digital nomad
is about being able

81
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:10,717
to live and work wherever you want.

82
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,392
It's not about always
having to be on the go,

83
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:17,098
moving from country to country,
or city to city every week.

84
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,481
It's just about having
the freedom to choose.

85
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,202
"I want to live in the country,

86
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,646
"and my company is in the city."

87
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:23,479
You can do that.

88
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:24,598
Or, "My company is in the city,

89
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,279
"and I want to live."

90
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,715
"I don't want to come in and commute

91
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:29,679
"and waste gas money, and time."

92
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:32,296
So I think it's more
about having that freedom

93
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:35,629
and that choice more than anything else.

94
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,968
- With Buffer I manage
to work from any place.

95
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,647
If I have internet, my
laptop is my office.

96
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,153
It doesn't quite matter where I am,

97
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,055
and that I really appreciate.

98
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,022
Could then be in the
coffee shop in the morning,

99
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,680
in the co-working space in the afternoon,

100
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,268
I only commute if I want to,

101
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:53,103
and that's a super cool luxury for me.

102
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:55,307
I think since I joined
Buffer I've been travelling

103
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:59,474
between 50 and 70% of my
time, so I, based in Paris,

104
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:02,103
and I go outside of France

105
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:05,686
and I discover new
places very, very often.

106
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:11,659
- One of the ways that
have really started working

107
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,314
very differently the past,

108
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:15,519
in particularly the past 20 years,

109
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,426
is that they have started
working in other places

110
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:21,426
than by their desks or workstations.

111
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,842
So this idea of flexible
working, mobile working,

112
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:43,778
itinerant working, the nomadic working,

113
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,256
all of these concepts,

114
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,227
they cover more or less
the same broad range

115
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:50,579
of phenomenon that people,

116
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,006
they don’t have to sit and
work where the data is.

117
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:06,398
- The whole digital
nomad movement right now

118
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:08,761
is exploding like crazy.

119
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:11,618
When I look back three or four years ago

120
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:14,756
when I started out as a digital nomad,

121
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:18,423
I remember we had our “The 4
Hour Work Week” meet up here

122
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:22,590
in Berlin and we met up in this
bar and we were four people.

123
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,231
And now over the years,

124
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,306
we’re now having conferences
for digital nomads

125
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,873
and there’s all these blogs,
there’s all these events,

126
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,073
there’s all these workshops,

127
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:39,484
there’s all these hubs
and Facebook groups.

128
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:42,952
It’s exploding and there’s
all this new infrastructure

129
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:44,866
that’s happening for digital nomads.

130
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:46,935
- Location independence,

131
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:49,588
digital nomads I suppose
later have existed

132
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:52,571
for a long time and well
before The 4-Hour Workweek.

133
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:01,968
What I attempted to do in
The 4-Hour Workweek was

134
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,303
to try to codify and gather a framework

135
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:06,656
and a collection of tools
for people who wanted

136
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:09,823
to take advantage of time and location

137
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,950
or mobility as currencies,
now forty languages later.

138
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,511
It seems like being a digital nomad,

139
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:17,803
if you want to do that,

140
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:20,364
is available to more
people than ever before.

141
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,680
As a function of technology
and also just a mind shift.

142
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,649
- I made a site called Nomad List

143
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,174
which ranks the top 100 cities
based on cost of living,

144
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,836
temperature, weather,
if there's nice places

145
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,762
to work, for example.

146
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:43,749
That site when viral.

147
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,996
It went on the front page of Reddit,

148
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:49,079
it came on Hacker News, Product Hunt.

149
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,625
According to my data, my
website the most popular place

150
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,750
for nomads right now are Chiang Mai,

151
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,610
still because traditionally
the starting place

152
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,777
for digital nomads, Bangkok,
Berlin, Budapest in Hungary,

153
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:07,628
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam,
Medellin in Colombia.

154
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:10,789
They're all kind of low cost of living,

155
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,872
warm, with fast internet.

156
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:30,928
- About 2 years ago, we opened
Hubud which is the largest

157
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:36,100
and the first co-working space in Bali.

158
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:53,733
The funny thing happened after we opened

159
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,651
which was it wasn’t people like us

160
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,402
that started coming to the space.

161
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,702
It was this new kind of person

162
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:03,126
who called themselves digital nomads.

163
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:06,054
We had never heard the term
digital nomad before we opened.

164
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:07,501
It was new to us.

165
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,334
But all of a sudden,

166
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,084
we became kind of a
mecca for digital nomads.

167
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,285
We had developers, we have designers,

168
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:22,798
we have startup business
development people.

169
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,826
We have photographers,
we have videographers.

170
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:28,364
It’s really the full gamut
of what is out there.

171
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:32,032
We did a recent survey just
last month and now about 90%

172
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:35,015
of our members consider
themselves digital nomads

173
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:37,432
or want to be digital nomads.

174
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,961
- This is a villa that's
associated with Hubud,

175
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,110
but they rent it out
to different start ups

176
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,013
or groups that come in.

177
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:48,534
We are renting it out for the month.

178
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:49,799
There's five rooms upstairs

179
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,954
and we basically use the
downstairs as our workspace

180
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:55,443
and a place to have meals
and things like that.

181
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:58,690
So Hacker Paradise started
in the summer of 2014.

182
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,300
We had about 20 to 30 developers down

183
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,309
in Costa Rica in the fall.

184
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:05,196
Then it was so much fun that
we just decided we wanted

185
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:08,779
to keep doing it and
see where it could go.

186
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,573
This is the main area where people work,

187
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:18,657
where we have food team
breakfast or lunch.

188
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:20,473
At the beginning of the
week we do where people get

189
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,872
to know each other and talk
about what they're working

190
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,660
on for the week.

191
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,827
Bean bag chairs, places
people set up a workspace.

192
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,727
It's pretty awesome to work here.

193
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:32,967
You can sit here at the desk

194
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,201
and you'd be looking out over rice fields,

195
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,675
and you can take a break
and jump in the pool.

196
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,063
It's pretty ideal.

197
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,875
You can kind of get all
your needs met here.

198
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,318
- I think the first time I really heard

199
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:45,598
about digital nomads was probably

200
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,920
from “The 4-Hour Workweek”.

201
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,087
So many people found out
about working and traveling.

202
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,527
One of the reasons that I wanted to travel

203
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:57,179
with a group like Hacker
Paradise instead of just going

204
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,943
by myself was I mean first of all

205
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:02,993
because this is my first time
doing the digital nomad thing,

206
00:13:02,993 --> 00:13:04,950
doing extended travel and working.

207
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,056
I wanted to find a community of people

208
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:10,526
that are doing the same thing.

209
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,344
One day I was sitting in
my apartment in Montreal

210
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:15,344
and it was minus 35, and I was like,

211
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:17,936
"I've had it, I've had enough."

212
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:22,817
I went online and I looked
up group trips for nomads,

213
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,674
where nomads meetup a lot,
and I found Hacker Paradise

214
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:29,841
and I applied and 3 weeks
later I got on the plane.

215
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:44,125
- Hubba is the first
co-working space in Thailand

216
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,894
for a very long time.

217
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:48,311
We were open since June 2012.

218
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,509
We’ve been for the past 3 years.

219
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,306
Now, we’re in 6 locations.

220
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:59,681
For Hubba, we’ve now have
about 150 people coming here

221
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:03,848
every day and over each month,
over 100 people visit us,

222
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,910
take a tour of the space

223
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,910
and many do decide to come and work.

224
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,311
We’ve got a great mix of both the expat

225
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:16,588
and digital nomad community.

226
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:21,350
It comprises of approximately
half of our membership

227
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,991
and the rest are Bangkokians
or Thais in general

228
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,779
from all across the country

229
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,956
that are working, living here in Bangkok.

230
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:47,597
- The idea of the Nomad Cruise
is actually quite simple.

231
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:49,055
Instead of taking an airplane,

232
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,222
we just meet on a cruise ship
with over 100 digital nomads

233
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:58,404
and on the cruise ship we
network, organize workshops,

234
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,620
conference and then when
we enter the new continent,

235
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,370
we travel the continent together.

236
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:13,193
We had all really very different skills.

237
00:15:13,193 --> 00:15:16,325
There not just programmers,
not just copywriters,

238
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:20,158
but really everything.

239
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:24,086
- If we wanted to dig
into the cultural shift

240
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:25,460
and the mind shift,

241
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,925
you have to look at the
development of technology.

242
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,129
Similarly you have now
not just IM or Skype,

243
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,463
you have tools like Slack,

244
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:36,838
you have all sorts of off-the-rack
tools that you can use

245
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:39,025
to build very large companies

246
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,592
without necessarily any headquarters,

247
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:44,777
without any of the
traditional accouterments,

248
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,404
or architecture of a large company.

249
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:54,075
- In an old industrial context,

250
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:57,259
people would tend to
work closely with people

251
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,118
who are very close to them

252
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:02,142
and because this was the
only way you could negotiate

253
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,349
what’s called mutual interdependencies.

254
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:07,279
So we need to able to talk to each other.

255
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,130
If you only have a carrier pigeon

256
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,630
or a telegraph to communicate,

257
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:15,470
if you have a lot of complicated work.

258
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,923
It will be a lot of pigeons
going backwards and forwards.

259
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:19,870
But of course with all

260
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,930
the modern communication
technologies we have,

261
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,352
you could say a lot of
these interdependencies

262
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:29,352
can be replaced with the
mediated communication.

263
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:32,759
They can be replaced with mobile phone,

264
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,104
Facebook, Twitter, all of these things.

265
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:38,421
So if we look at this to build the teams,

266
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:41,221
they have been coming from
many, many, many years

267
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:44,188
and the idea of having global development

268
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:46,829
of products, of all social services,

269
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:49,597
global support for
services and outsourcing,

270
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:52,275
offshoring, all of those
things have happened

271
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,642
for 30, 40 years.

272
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,033
- Most people who work today,

273
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,678
even if they're in an office
are already working remotely.

274
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:00,598
They're already using email remotely,

275
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,255
they're already using IM,

276
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,646
not everything is happening
just in a face-to-face meeting.

277
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:08,401
There's actually not that much
out of a traditional office

278
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:09,444
that you have to figure out,

279
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,103
"Oh, how are we going to do that?"

280
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,102
- I had my first proper nine to five back

281
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:29,011
when I was I guess maybe
26 and after a few weeks

282
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:32,844
of having this Monday
to Friday, nine to five.

283
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:37,042
I would be on the train,
going to work, into the office

284
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:39,407
and I would be thinking,
“Wow, this is 30 minutes.

285
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:40,370
"This evening 30 minutes.

286
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,512
"That’s 1 hour in a day.

287
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:43,267
"That’s 5 hours a week.

288
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,699
"That’s 20 hours a month

289
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:49,433
"that I’m wasting sitting
on public transport."

290
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,123
You live for the weekend,

291
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:53,724
you can’t wait until
you can finally go home

292
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,943
and I was like, “What is this?”

293
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:03,795
Getting rid of a commute
gives you more time

294
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,019
to make dinner with my husband,

295
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,818
we have more time to hang out.

296
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:09,346
We can have coffee in the morning

297
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:13,179
and talk about our day
instead of rushing off.

298
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:15,934
Often I will go out to meet friends

299
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,338
at rush hour for drinks.

300
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:20,219
They'll get together at
5 or 6 p.m. after work,

301
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,657
and I'll find myself stuck in traffic,

302
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:23,295
and I'm like, "What's happening?"

303
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:24,941
I totally forget that everyone else

304
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,239
in the world is commuting

305
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,222
and it's a totally normal experience

306
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:33,002
that I just haven't had in so
long that I totally forget.

307
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:46,181
- It’s really, really becoming
unaffordable and unobtainable

308
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:48,638
for a lot of people in San Francisco.

309
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:51,956
What’s really happened
in the last few years is

310
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:54,662
that the epicenter of
techs moved into the city.

311
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,630
San Francisco is a really small city

312
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,458
and it has strict housing
development guidelines.

313
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,195
The property development
has just not happened

314
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:04,610
as the speed of people coming in and out.

315
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,570
What we’ve really seen is everything

316
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,649
is gone up ridiculous amounts, salaries,

317
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,816
commuting cost, living cost,
rental, everything like that.

318
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,162
- We just look at the cost
of living in San Francisco.

319
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:29,000
Now, all of those places,
the average cost is $3,100.

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,149
$3,100 for a one bedroom apartment,

321
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:36,316
that's not as nice as the one
we have here for under 700.

322
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,405
Being from San Francisco,

323
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:43,232
my mom was a waitress in San Francisco,

324
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:45,180
I think in the early 80s

325
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,338
and she purchased a house
on a waitress salary.

326
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:51,088
Now, that house in a terrible neighborhood

327
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:55,255
in San Francisco is worth
well over a million dollars.

328
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:58,513
That doesn’t even make sense now

329
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:01,430
because you can’t purchase a house.

330
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:06,351
- The same in Holland.

331
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:10,362
Everybody comes to
Amsterdam because of jobs.

332
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:13,695
Over here, it’s overcrowded, overpriced,

333
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:18,133
if you want to live a cheaper life,

334
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,946
buy a cheaper house, you
just go to the northern

335
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:24,501
or the south then you don’t have a job.

336
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,478
So that’s the problem

337
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:28,897
and I think that’s the problem
many countries are facing

338
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,392
at the moment.

339
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:33,634
- Historically, every single
person has been moving

340
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,899
towards better jobs, better
career opportunities.

341
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,967
The entire history of economic migration

342
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,872
of the world has been about
getting to where the jobs are.

343
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:44,307
But at the same time there
is now this complete new set

344
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:46,514
of people who can work anywhere

345
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:47,972
which has not been possible before is

346
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:49,797
that people have this
liberty to move around

347
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:52,276
and they can have a much more choice

348
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:53,836
about what other jobs they do locally,

349
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,182
what other jobs they take with them

350
00:20:56,182 --> 00:21:00,344
and changing their location
is the biggest lever they have

351
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,622
when changing their quality of life.

352
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:07,441
- If you work online, you don’t
need to be in the same area

353
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:12,186
like Rotterdam or Amsterdam,
you can work wherever you like.

354
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,839
You just need your laptop and that’s it.

355
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,904
You don’t have to be in this
overcrowded, overpriced places.

356
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:22,271
- Not everything has to
happen in San Francisco.

357
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,266
Not everyone has to be here.

358
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:27,437
For people that want to live
elsewhere and still access some

359
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:29,337
of the best tech companies in the world,

360
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:32,837
working remotely is a really great option.

361
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:38,618
- When I first wanted to
become a digital nomad,

362
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:41,759
I researched all the options and ideas.

363
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,009
I had found GitHub

364
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,592
which apparently is a
developers dream job.

365
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:52,102
Right now, GitHub is over 300
employees, around 300-350,

366
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:56,269
and over half are remote,
and half are at headquarters.

367
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,437
If you live in San Francisco,
you can also work from home,

368
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:03,039
you can work at a coffee shop,

369
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,789
you can work anywhere you'd like.

370
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,205
In Morocco, I will be at this co-living,

371
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,746
coworking space called SunDesk.

372
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:17,146
It's owned by a German girl

373
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:19,111
and it's a whole house.

374
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:20,981
Basically, we just have great internet,

375
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:23,893
we work with other
entrepreneurs, other companies

376
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,174
and we just go sun and surf at the beach.

377
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:27,007
So I'll be safe.

378
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:28,802
I'm not really alone.

379
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:31,367
- Yeah, but do you know
anybody over there?

380
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,200
- [Amy] No.

381
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,416
- You're just meeting
people for the first time?

382
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,289
- Yeah.

383
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,432
My parents, they really support me.

384
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:41,116
They love that I travel a lot.

385
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,269
They're okay with my adventurous spirit.

386
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:52,461
They just wish I would
pick very careful places.

387
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:55,184
- Well, 5 years ago I kind of thought

388
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:57,364
I wanted her to be traditional,

389
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:59,290
but after 5 years now I kind of think

390
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,373
it's a little different.

391
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:05,615
My whole thing is
whatever makes her happy.

392
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:08,448
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.

393
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,930
- I've been a digital nomad since 2009

394
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,263
so about six years actually.

395
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,905
I've been travelling for
the last two and half years

396
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:09,800
with my girlfriend.

397
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,967
There have definitely been
a few really hard moments

398
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:16,938
especially in the beginning.

399
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:19,781
I mean for her, she had
this huge life change

400
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:23,743
where she quit her job, was
trying to start a business,

401
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:26,838
left her home country for the first time.

402
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:29,578
So you have all these
major life changes going on

403
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:32,682
so that was incredibly stressful on her.

404
00:26:32,682 --> 00:26:36,233
For me, I'd always traveled by myself.

405
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:37,776
Suddenly I'm traveling with my girlfriend

406
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:38,952
and it's completely different

407
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:41,252
like you're having to make
compromises all the time.

408
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:42,101
- If you're like,

409
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,024
"Uh, I quit my job to travel with you

410
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:47,357
"and now my life is a mess."

411
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:53,457
Then it's the first thing
that kills a relationship.

412
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:56,819
So if we have any hard moments in those.

413
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:00,380
Oh, yeah.

414
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,047
I love cleaning and I
love organized spaces.

415
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,163
Mark doesn't care.

416
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:11,485
He used to be like that 20
minutes before we leave a place,

417
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:14,486
he would like, "Ah, I'm done",

418
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:18,090
and then he opens the
suitcases like an atomic bomb.

419
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,934
My suitcase is like he
said, it's like a Tetris.

420
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,944
I know exactly where everything is,

421
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:29,035
and when I don't know,
I start freaking out.

422
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:29,973
- What's wrong?

423
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:34,140
- I have no idea where is my card.

424
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:37,914
- Your bank card or your ID?

425
00:27:37,914 --> 00:27:39,529
- No my bank card.

426
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:42,478
My ID is with you.

427
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,472
I'm a little desperate.

428
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:48,480
- This happens all the time.

429
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,633
- No, you're not taking me seriously?

430
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:52,978
- We found it.

431
00:27:52,978 --> 00:27:54,525
- Welcome to my world.

432
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:57,163
Like I feel like I'm
going to have a stroke.

433
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:58,375
- It's like the boy who cried wolf,

434
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:01,978
like she loses so much stuff
all the time that like,

435
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:03,463
I don't even get worried.

436
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:06,188
I get worried when two hours go by,

437
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:08,921
because like 99% of the time she finds it

438
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,474
in the most obvious place.

439
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:14,474
- Five minutes, yeah.

440
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:21,065
- We actually realized at
the time that it was like

441
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:24,565
if we survive this we're going to be okay?

442
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,168
We did survive, it got better.

443
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:32,085
We started adjusting to each other.

444
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:37,529
I think it's going to be
interesting going forward

445
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:41,450
because, people, they want
a long term relationships.

446
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,827
They're getting more
interested in marriage, kids.

447
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:46,817
I think this is going to raise a lot

448
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:48,352
of challenges and questions.

449
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,693
I don't think anybody knows
what's it going to look like

450
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:53,235
but I definitely think this is going

451
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:55,235
to become a major topic.

452
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,315
- We have two daughters.

453
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:10,482
Hannah, the bigger one, she
was now in over 30 countries.

454
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,515
The little one started a bit later,

455
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:21,148
so I guess she has 10 or 12
countries less on her list.

456
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:23,222
- For us, it was clear we
want to have kids together,

457
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:27,305
but it was also clear we
want to travel together.

458
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:29,708
We were not sure from the beginning

459
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:33,616
on how it will be to travel with kids.

460
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:37,353
We decided that our first
trip will be by car,

461
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:40,247
that we can always come
back if something happens.

462
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:43,761
We visited, I think, 11
countries at this time

463
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:46,376
and was very beautiful time of our life.

464
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:50,543
We decided that we have to
make more kids and travel more!

465
00:29:54,954 --> 00:29:56,661
They are used to different people,

466
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,392
they are used to different languages.

467
00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:02,062
They can speak three
languages already now.

468
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,397
They speak Polish with
me, German with Tom,

469
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:06,091
and they learned English

470
00:30:06,091 --> 00:30:09,508
because we speak English with each other.

471
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:15,130
I also know that our
kids really understand

472
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,547
this definition of different.

473
00:30:21,762 --> 00:30:23,825
For them, it's not only
one language in the world

474
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:27,423
or one way of people
celebrating Christmas,

475
00:30:27,423 --> 00:30:29,002
because from the beginning on,

476
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:31,919
they knew it can be very different.

477
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:42,764
- Kids can be really
annoying when they said like,

478
00:30:42,764 --> 00:30:43,645
"I want this!"

479
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,353
or "I don't want this!"

480
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:49,358
and then they stand there
and they will not walk.

481
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:51,095
But this can happen anywhere.

482
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:54,113
That has nothing to do with
trips but with personalities.

483
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,967
It doesn't depend too
much on the circumstances

484
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:58,634
from my perspective.

485
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:02,916
I first communicated in
other language when I was,

486
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,447
I don't know, probably 17 or 18.

487
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,066
It's incredible to see

488
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:10,233
how different beginning our kids have.

489
00:31:18,856 --> 00:31:22,722
- This idea of becoming digital nomads,

490
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:26,365
it didn’t really exist when we
started thinking about this,

491
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,352
because people didn’t work remotely.

492
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:30,350
- It used to be that
you had to either retire

493
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,180
or put your life on hold
in order to pick up stakes

494
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,278
and not be in the same place all the time.

495
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,083
- For us the biggest obstacle was my work.

496
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,550
My work in a law firm with clients

497
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,438
in North Carolina was pretty rooted

498
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:50,339
in the idea of being
present with those people.

499
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:53,922
We had to figure out
a way to get that done

500
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:59,083
and to make clients feel like
they were being taken care of

501
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,626
even if I wasn’t going
to be physically present.

502
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:06,785
We moved toward having everyone
on the team work remotely,

503
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:09,459
and we brought in a lot of new technology

504
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:12,430
into the business in order
to facilitate remote work.

505
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,745
We have spent years now putting all

506
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:17,869
of those pieces in place
so that I can sit here

507
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,901
in Berlin or in a co-working
space in Hong Kong

508
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:24,278
and run the law firm just
as I would have sitting

509
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,528
in Raleigh, North Carolina.

510
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,920
- We’ve been working on this for years,

511
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,997
and then we spent years
getting rid of our house

512
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:35,914
and getting rid of our possessions,

513
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:39,969
and during this time we
were preparing our children

514
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:42,833
to be adults.

515
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,833
I mean this didn’t happen overnight.

516
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:52,869
- Being homeless is working
out pretty well for us.

517
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,619
- Yeah, exactly.

518
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,734
When we started this
process we talked a lot

519
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:04,315
about minimalism and materialism

520
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:08,482
and getting rid of our things
independently of traveling.

521
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:12,654
- Going through this cleaning out

522
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:17,428
of things has really caused
us to reflect on materialism

523
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:21,247
and to think about why we did
all of the things that we did.

524
00:33:21,247 --> 00:33:23,718
I look at what I own
which just literally fits

525
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,503
in in a carry-on, and I have
nothing else in the world,

526
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:28,655
I mean that's it.

527
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:32,147
It just disturbs me that
I spent so much energy

528
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:36,936
and time thinking about wanting
and searching for things

529
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:41,103
and now I don’t have any of
them and I don’t miss them.

530
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:46,269
So our experience is
when we have a routine

531
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:48,606
and we’re living the same life,

532
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,606
those days do feel like they fly by.

533
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:53,819
When you get up in a new place each day

534
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:55,956
and you have a new
experience for breakfast

535
00:33:55,956 --> 00:33:58,091
and where you’re working
and what you’re doing

536
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:59,622
and somewhere interesting for lunch

537
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,290
and something different
happens in the afternoon,

538
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,123
and you go for a walk

539
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,409
in a new neighborhood you’ve
never been to that evening,

540
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,066
and then you have ice cream at
the place that you discover.

541
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:10,839
Boy, your days feel like
weeks if not months,

542
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:13,252
and it really changes
your perception of time.

543
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,500
And as you get older,

544
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,667
if there’s anything that you
would want it's more time.

545
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:44,306
- My name is Joel Gascoigne,

546
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:48,066
I'm the co-founder and CEO of Buffer.

547
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:50,568
We all work, spread all across the world,

548
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:52,270
so right now we came together,

549
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,353
to be together for one
and half weeks in Iceland.

550
00:35:06,402 --> 00:35:08,765
You kind of have that full
spectrum of digital nomad

551
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:11,187
where maybe travel for several months

552
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:14,450
and some people are just
fixed in one location.

553
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,254
Other people are traveling
every couple of weeks.

554
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:21,471
I often don’t even know where somebody is,

555
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:24,609
so what we found is video
calls are essential,

556
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:28,776
because you can see the facial
emotions and everything.

557
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:33,717
It's also why we have regular
retreats every six months,

558
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,327
we all come together in
one place in the world

559
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:38,392
and spend a week and half together.

560
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:41,543
You can always hear their
voice when you read the emails

561
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:44,197
or the text based chat after the retreat.

562
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:47,355
That's why we found it
has to be a combination,

563
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:51,146
we've got to come together
regularly and there's benefits

564
00:35:51,146 --> 00:35:54,871
like it's really great to work remotely

565
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:57,621
and in a distributed way as well.

566
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:02,551
- Every time I go visit
someone's fancy startup office,

567
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:05,391
I'm like, "Oh, yeah, this is really fun."

568
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:08,173
It would be fun to visit for a while.

569
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:10,478
I don't think I would want to stay.

570
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:13,199
There's no better office
for me than at home

571
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,282
or wherever I want to be.

572
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,485
I think once you've had that
freedom that remote work brings

573
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:23,445
and had that different experience,

574
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,037
a whole different way of working,

575
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:26,988
that feeling of productivity,

576
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:31,921
I think that going back to
traditional work might be hard.

577
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:34,997
It might not feel as
fun or as happy for me

578
00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:37,651
as remote work does at Buffer.

579
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:40,676
- If you think about how much
work you actually get done

580
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:44,047
at your full-time job,
most people are not ashamed

581
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:47,264
to tell you that I get 2
hours of work done a day,

582
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:49,514
3 hours of work done a day.

583
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,174
There is this joke about
meetings for meetings

584
00:36:53,174 --> 00:36:54,835
and things like that.

585
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:58,272
Why force them to sit there,
why force them to be at work.

586
00:36:58,272 --> 00:37:02,094
You’re on Facebook or you’re
on Reddit or Hacker News,

587
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,491
and you’re just wasting time
because you’re not in the zone.

588
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:09,562
You’re not feeling what
you need to be working on.

589
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,533
It’s the opposite as a digital nomad.

590
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,355
You structure your life

591
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:17,265
around these little
pockets of productivity,

592
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:19,598
and they’re very productive.

593
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:37,563
- Some managers think I
have to be in the office

594
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:40,817
and I have to be able to
physically see the people

595
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:43,030
that I’m managing
otherwise it doesn’t work.

596
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,030
How do I know if they work?

597
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,185
You hire good people and you trust them.

598
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:48,238
That’s how it works.

599
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:49,926
You verify their work product.

600
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:51,126
That’s how it works.

601
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,415
Just physically being able
to see whether somebody comes

602
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:56,664
in exactly at nine or
whether they stay past four.

603
00:37:56,664 --> 00:38:00,831
It’s a very crude rudimentary
even pre-civilization way

604
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,102
of managing people like,
“I can physically see you.

605
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:05,247
"I have line of sight.

606
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:08,080
"Thus I know that you’re working.”

607
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:16,723
Today is Monday, and
we're a remote company,

608
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:19,473
and there's nobody at the office.

609
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,585
We have about 10, 12 people in Chicago,

610
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:26,700
and some days there'll
be a bunch of people,

611
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,556
maybe seven or eight people.

612
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,051
Twice a year, we fly everyone
in and the office is packed,

613
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:35,384
because we'll have about 50 people here.

614
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,649
This is pinning in everyone we had

615
00:38:41,649 --> 00:38:44,178
at the company at the last meetup.

616
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:46,271
You see, there's a bunch
of people spread out

617
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:50,879
all over Chicago, a couple
people in Canada as well.

618
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:54,124
Then the second biggest spot
that we have is in the UK.

619
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:57,041
Me down here in the south of Spain.

620
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:01,438
One person in Australia.

621
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:04,438
One person in Hong Kong.

622
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:07,734
That's our map of the world.

623
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:12,891
When we started working together,

624
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:14,408
I was in Copenhagen, Denmark,

625
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:16,502
seven time zones away
from Jason here in Chicago

626
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:18,140
and the rest of the team.

627
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,857
So the whole foundation story

628
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,751
of Basecamp is one of remote work.

629
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:25,799
Even though we actually have
10 or 12 people in Chicago,

630
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,395
the bulk of them still work from home.

631
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:28,979
They probably go to
the office occasionally

632
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:32,272
because the office is an option.

633
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:35,605
It’s just a nice perk to have
for the people who are here.

634
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,246
When we gather people
up a few times a year,

635
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:40,896
it’s a great place to meet and hangout.

636
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:43,146
But it’s entirely optional.

637
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,366
It’s expensive to buy a big office.

638
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:48,519
It’s expensive to relocate people.

639
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,404
It’s hard to relocate people.

640
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:52,334
To hire people all over the place,

641
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:56,334
it was just so much easier
to let them be there.

642
00:39:57,227 --> 00:40:00,011
I think remote work works
for all kinds of people.

643
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:02,733
I think most people who have a job to do

644
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,261
in front of the computer

645
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:07,265
or otherwise producing some
sort of intellectual output.

646
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:08,929
Yes, if you need to manage a machine,

647
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:09,908
and you need to stand there,

648
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,106
and you need to move things around,

649
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:12,681
of course you have to
be near that machine,

650
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:15,135
but less and less jobs are like that.

651
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:18,119
More and more jobs these
days are about sitting

652
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,053
in front of computer,
communicating, collaborating,

653
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:25,925
producing something in
front of a computer.

654
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:29,836
All the savings you can have
on offices and so forth,

655
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:32,224
that's been one of the big
drivers for other big companies

656
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:35,025
like IBM that's down-sized their offices

657
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:37,455
because they let people work
from home, and they realized,

658
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:38,744
"We don't need as many desks.

659
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,860
"Oh, we can save a whole
lot on real estate."

660
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:52,134
- The rise of more and more jobs

661
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:53,924
that are remote work capable.

662
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:57,729
More jobs that get
convergent information work.

663
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:59,447
The more kinds of things you can do over

664
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:00,522
an internet connection from anywhere.

665
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,060
Obviously software development

666
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,787
but a little less obviously
writing, law, graphic design

667
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:08,031
and then less obviously still overtime

668
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:10,055
as we get in robotic surgery.

669
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:13,141
You can do medicine over
an internet connection.

670
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:14,448
Construction, you can operate drones

671
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:16,699
over an internet connection
and things of that nature.

672
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:18,390
You can be able to do more

673
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,416
and more jobs over an internet connection.

674
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,828
As we start having
software industry people

675
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:26,659
become more capable of doing remote work.

676
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:29,515
- It’s interesting to see the
trends about remote working.

677
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:33,815
Some companies are really
welcoming remote with open arms

678
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:37,116
if you think about Dell is
welcoming remote working

679
00:41:37,116 --> 00:41:40,028
and then it’s trickling down
all the way to more companies.

680
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:43,070
What we really get to see
is the work flexibility

681
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:46,534
in the U.S. and across the
world is really going up.

682
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:47,536
More and more people are working

683
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:50,901
for themselves or with more flexibility.

684
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:53,551
- Automattic has a
headquarters in San Francisco.

685
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:56,359
We need some place to
get mail and do meetings

686
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:57,609
but the vast majority,

687
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:58,928
there’s only about 20 people there

688
00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:02,378
so 95% of the company is
outside San Francisco.

689
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:14,224
Now close to 400 people all over the world

690
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:15,974
in over 47 countries.

691
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:19,460
We have always believed that great work,

692
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,670
collaboration, could be done online.

693
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,539
My name is Matt Mullenweg.

694
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:27,625
I'm the co-founding
developer of WordPress.

695
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:38,069
- Why would I ever try to uproot people

696
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:41,633
and move them to San Francisco
or build just an office

697
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:42,925
and only hire people here?

698
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:45,638
It's obvious that there's
so many amazing people

699
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:48,610
all over the world, and
I want to work with them.

700
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,183
The internet is pretty good,

701
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:54,766
why not just hire people
wherever they are?

702
00:42:56,725 --> 00:43:00,174
- For me, working remotely is essential.

703
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:02,958
I'm really bad at going to an office.

704
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,874
I can't do it.

705
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,591
After around two weeks of going

706
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:09,883
to the same place I get stir
crazy and don't do anything.

707
00:43:09,883 --> 00:43:12,432
I'm also really bad living in one place

708
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:14,438
because after around a
month of being somewhere

709
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:17,149
I get really bored and start
having a week of burnout

710
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:20,732
where I just sit and
watch TV or something.

711
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,321
I am much happier as a
person and more productive

712
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:28,373
in the long-term if I had the ability to,

713
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:29,904
every few hours be like,

714
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:30,999
"I'm going to go take a break now

715
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:33,388
"for 30 minutes and see something new."

716
00:43:33,388 --> 00:43:35,259
I just find that, in general,

717
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:38,718
helps my particular style
of working a lot more.

718
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,222
- One interesting stat, since
joining Zapier more than half

719
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:44,497
of the people have moved and moved

720
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,658
to a completely different city.

721
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,506
Even from people who are from families

722
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:52,807
and so that’s kind of I think
the lifestyle affordances

723
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:55,470
that remote gives you
makes it a lot easier

724
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,160
even if you have a family
and a little bit settled.

725
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,163
It makes it a lot easier to decide,

726
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:03,726
we are going to move a little
bit closer to our family,

727
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,102
a family member who gets sick

728
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:06,899
or something like that because we can.

729
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:09,634
We don’t have to worry about
the hassles of resigning

730
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:12,686
from this job and finding
a new job elsewhere.

731
00:44:12,686 --> 00:44:17,173
They can just pick up and move
somewhere else if need be.

732
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,685
- There's companies that
are finding new ways

733
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:27,576
to work that allow people
to set their own hours,

734
00:44:27,576 --> 00:44:30,969
have more flexibility, live
wherever they want in the world,

735
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:34,416
and they're going to attract
the best people in the world

736
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:35,464
because the best people

737
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,745
in the world are largely going to think,

738
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:39,471
"Why do I have to commute
to Mountain View every day

739
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,985
"and sit in a bunch of
meetings and things like that?

740
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:44,744
"Maybe I want to live in
Mountain View part of the year,

741
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:46,910
"but maybe during the
summer I want to go to Italy

742
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,384
"or to Thailand or Australia,
or wherever it is."

743
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:52,774
It doesn't matter, it's just
giving them the flexibility

744
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,691
to be in control of their own life.

745
00:44:56,624 --> 00:44:59,006
In the future they will
either be distributed

746
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:02,074
or they'll be overtaken
by companies that are

747
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,403
because the smartest people
in the world are going

748
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:06,486
to want to work this way.

749
00:45:13,686 --> 00:45:17,072
- Something that it took
me three or four years

750
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:18,688
to start to realize is

751
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:21,271
that this is a very extreme lifestyle.

752
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:25,037
This is a lifestyle that is
constantly bombarding you

753
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:28,528
with new experiences and new perspectives.

754
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:30,669
And this can be very powerful,

755
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:33,094
but what I've discovered is
that it can be very powerful

756
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:36,094
both in a positive and negative way.

757
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:48,286
The idea was basically by working online,

758
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:50,743
by being an entrepreneur working remotely

759
00:45:50,743 --> 00:45:53,952
you can build all this
freedom and independence

760
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:57,151
for yourself that you couldn’t do before.

761
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,060
The nature of that idea
allows for this kind

762
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,729
of pyramid scheme to
open up underneath them.

763
00:46:03,729 --> 00:46:06,026
- “Are you sick of
your ordinary boring life?

764
00:46:06,026 --> 00:46:08,344
"Are you tired of doing
stuff you don't like

765
00:46:08,344 --> 00:46:10,139
"and being stuck in your
stupid cubicle everyday?

766
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:12,321
- “Oh my god. I need to start a website

767
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:15,338
"or start a company that will
let me live anywhere I want.

768
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:16,308
"What do I talk about?

769
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:17,893
"I have no idea.

770
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:20,013
"I’ll just write about
going and living the dream

771
00:46:20,013 --> 00:46:23,181
"and living on a beach and
following your own passions

772
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:24,228
"and all this stuff.”

773
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:25,868
Then they go out and they write that.

774
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:28,326
They stumble across it and
they pay this person money

775
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:31,666
and all these people are
like, “Where do I start?”

776
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,499
“I don't know.

777
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,815
"I’ll start a website about
how to take more control

778
00:46:34,815 --> 00:46:38,219
"of your life and how to live in a beach.”

779
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:40,506
This pyramid scheme opens up

780
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,506
and it fills out these
deeper and deeper niches.

781
00:47:15,503 --> 00:47:16,754
- There’s a lot of people

782
00:47:16,754 --> 00:47:19,837
that have an over optimistic view of,

783
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:26,439
“Hey, let’s come to Southeast Asia,

784
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:30,794
"live cheap, drink party and
do all sorts of naughty stuff

785
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,044
"and have an amazing time."

786
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:43,174
- I feel like sometimes
people misinterpret that.

787
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:45,962
They’re always writing
these stupid Medium articles

788
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:48,854
and articles that they want posted about,

789
00:47:48,854 --> 00:47:52,159
“Quit your job and live in
Thailand for $50 a day.”

790
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:55,521
That doesn’t work for everyone.

791
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:58,046
- A lot of people are making money off

792
00:47:58,046 --> 00:48:01,585
of selling you the digital
nomad lifestyle dream.

793
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:04,021
They want you to buy their $39
eBook to sell you the dream

794
00:48:04,021 --> 00:48:08,819
because they’re living in
Bali and they need money too.

795
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,986
There’s a lot of hype about
it that it doesn’t live up to.

796
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:17,749
It’s really more like do you
prefer living in an apartment,

797
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:20,947
in a city or do you prefer
living in a house in the country?

798
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:23,649
It’s not that one is
better than the other,

799
00:48:23,649 --> 00:48:25,766
it’s just that these are
different lifestyles.

800
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:29,521
- You’re not going to
automatically become rich just

801
00:48:29,521 --> 00:48:32,688
because you live in a cheaper country.

802
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:40,175
It really depends on
what you’re working on,

803
00:48:40,175 --> 00:48:41,226
how would you monetize,

804
00:48:41,226 --> 00:48:42,383
how well do you understand the market,

805
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:45,550
how well are you solving the problems.

806
00:49:16,051 --> 00:49:19,306
- One of the tricky part is
when you live on the road,

807
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:21,470
every second months like
I’m doing right now is

808
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,522
the one sentence I’m saying very often

809
00:49:23,522 --> 00:49:25,355
when I get to meet someone is,

810
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:27,746
“I will be leaving in two weeks.”

811
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:29,769
Loneliness is the real thing.

812
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:32,071
For many reasons when you
are in your home country,

813
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:35,644
and it’s a Friday night, you
can just pick up the phone,

814
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:37,265
call a friend, see what’s happening

815
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,689
or just walk to your local bar.

816
00:49:39,689 --> 00:49:41,968
When we’re in some place
completely different,

817
00:49:41,968 --> 00:49:45,255
being in a small village or
in a huge city doesn’t matter.

818
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:49,255
It’s really much harder
for you to be connected.

819
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:52,411
- Sometimes the weekend was suddenly calm

820
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:56,006
and I’ve not planned any activity,

821
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:58,019
I have not reached out
and tried to meet people

822
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,285
and it’s just really hard.

823
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:01,203
I didn’t have anything to do.

824
00:50:01,203 --> 00:50:03,960
Sometimes that would just
be really lonely feeling

825
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,127
and I felt really quite down
with more than I’ve ever felt.

826
00:50:10,117 --> 00:50:13,284
- It’s really hard.

827
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:16,661
Long distance relationships really suck

828
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:20,078
and it’s hard to find interesting people.

829
00:50:25,101 --> 00:50:26,530
That’s tough.

830
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,371
I haven’t fixed that one.

831
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,728
- I hear a lot about from single nomads

832
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:38,989
about being lonesome.

833
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:41,967
Being married is a huge advantage.

834
00:50:41,967 --> 00:50:44,149
Being a couple, being nomadic,

835
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:46,878
because you just don’t have that issue.

836
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,681
You aren’t going to be lonesome.

837
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:51,408
You may have to go out and build
other relationships outside

838
00:50:51,408 --> 00:50:54,107
of the marriage but
you’ve always got somebody

839
00:50:54,107 --> 00:50:57,247
that you can go back and talk to.

840
00:50:57,247 --> 00:51:00,080
To me that makes this really easy.

841
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,936
Now at the same time, we laugh about this,

842
00:51:07,936 --> 00:51:09,114
because all the young nomads,

843
00:51:09,114 --> 00:51:13,677
they’re all on Tinder dating
everybody that they can date.

844
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:14,912
- Swipe, swipe.

845
00:51:14,912 --> 00:51:16,447
- That's also one of the disadvantages

846
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:20,614
of being a married nomad.

847
00:51:22,874 --> 00:51:26,365
- We have each other to
bounce things off of,

848
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:29,963
I always have a calming
influence when I’m freaking out

849
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:34,130
about how hot it is or the taxi
that didn’t show up on time

850
00:51:35,156 --> 00:51:37,543
or the train that’s stuck
in the middle of nowhere

851
00:51:37,543 --> 00:51:41,015
and I don't know where we
are, whatever the issue is,

852
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:45,004
because there are going to
be issues, I have backup.

853
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:47,536
- If things don’t work
out I can always swipe.

854
00:51:47,536 --> 00:51:50,119
- You can swipe.
- Swipe right.

855
00:51:51,962 --> 00:51:54,533
- One of the big topics of conversations

856
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,405
between me and nomad friends,

857
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,354
and also friends at home
is relationships, or like,

858
00:51:59,354 --> 00:52:00,223
"How is your love life?

859
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:02,560
"How is dating?"

860
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,060
I do have to say it is harder than normal.

861
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:10,137
I've talked to many, many
friends, girls and guys,

862
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:13,146
about dating, and a lot of them are like,

863
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:16,466
"Amy, you have to stay somewhere
for a decent amount of time

864
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,514
"to begin dating and meet someone to stay

865
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:19,656
"with them long term."

866
00:52:19,656 --> 00:52:22,672
I think that's the
dilemma with nomads today.

867
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,857
When you're sick and
traveling around the world,

868
00:52:24,857 --> 00:52:25,928
you still want people around.

869
00:52:25,928 --> 00:52:27,397
When you're having a bad day,

870
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,051
you still want friends
and family and people

871
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:30,884
to be thinking of you.

872
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:34,371
- I definitely think this lifestyle

873
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:37,622
complicates dating in many ways.

874
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:39,851
Most digital nomads
they’re still pretty young

875
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:43,542
and we’re all aging together
and what I’m noticing

876
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,781
as the years go on,

877
00:52:45,781 --> 00:52:49,347
this is becoming more
and more of an issue.

878
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:51,149
A lot more people are talking about it

879
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:53,718
and are getting frustrated about it.

880
00:52:53,718 --> 00:52:56,036
- Where loneliness now
becomes more of an issue

881
00:52:56,036 --> 00:53:00,203
is with the other two problems,
isolation and depression.

882
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:05,848
If loneliness starts to get too intense,

883
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,780
people can start to feel isolated

884
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,041
especially if they’re in a culture

885
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,856
where they don’t speak the language

886
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:13,467
and they don’t know anyone that sense

887
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:17,634
of isolation will eventually
turn into depression.

888
00:53:19,736 --> 00:53:23,790
Where you’re born or where
you live doesn’t always have

889
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,689
that much of an impact
on your mental health.

890
00:53:26,689 --> 00:53:30,303
What does have a positive
impact on your mental health

891
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:33,149
though is having a community,

892
00:53:33,149 --> 00:53:36,410
having again that
support network of people

893
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,077
that you can access.

894
00:53:39,986 --> 00:53:43,015
It’s really about forming that network.

895
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:44,518
That can happen anywhere.

896
00:53:44,518 --> 00:53:47,751
That doesn’t have to be where
you grew up and where you went

897
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:51,918
to school or where you happen
to be living in that moment.

898
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:57,966
- If you’re a guy living this lifestyle

899
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,759
and you start to get lonely,

900
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:03,460
it’s very easy to fall into
this trap of just like,

901
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,802
some of these countries,

902
00:54:04,802 --> 00:54:07,437
like prostitutes are very inexpensive

903
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:10,966
so you see a lot of guys
falling into that trap.

904
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:13,796
- “Meet hot girls
and party like crazy"

905
00:54:13,796 --> 00:54:17,288
- Guys who have never actually
experience that intimacy

906
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:20,600
or like a healthy dating relationship,

907
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,860
they don’t realize that.

908
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,360
They just assume, dating is just about sex

909
00:54:26,322 --> 00:54:30,489
and these girls want to
have sex with me so why not.

910
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,364
- Sex tourism is always
prevalent in Southeast Asia,

911
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:39,274
low income communities across the world.

912
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:42,767
There’s a lot of women
that are forced into it.

913
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:46,102
There’s a lot of issues around the mafia.

914
00:54:46,102 --> 00:54:49,311
There’s loads of women
that are digital nomads,

915
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:51,057
that are part of this community,

916
00:54:51,057 --> 00:54:53,660
and also the LGBT community,

917
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,975
and we have to be mindful
that some of the things

918
00:54:56,975 --> 00:55:01,476
that a lot of the digital
nomads take for granted

919
00:55:01,476 --> 00:55:04,087
and think that it's an all-male community

920
00:55:04,087 --> 00:55:07,254
or male-dominated makes it uninclusive

921
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:12,288
and repulsive for some people.

922
00:55:13,983 --> 00:55:16,201
- It’s a danger of a lifestyle

923
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:18,744
that definitely is tabooed to talk about.

924
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:22,577
Not many people talk
about it openly but yeah,

925
00:55:23,498 --> 00:55:28,480
it’s an issue and I think more
people should talk about it.

926
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,082
- A sexpat is a guy who’s here just to,

927
00:55:31,082 --> 00:55:32,405
maybe he’s an older gentleman.

928
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:35,158
He wants to hit on young Thai girls.

929
00:55:35,158 --> 00:55:39,588
Enjoy the underground sex
industry here in Thailand.

930
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:42,505
These are the people we don’t want.

931
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:53,630
How do we differentiate a
digital nomad from that guy?

932
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:57,088
These are the sort of things
that we have to think about

933
00:55:57,088 --> 00:56:00,464
and actually start coming up
with solutions for in order

934
00:56:00,464 --> 00:56:03,560
to actually obtain some
sort of Visa program

935
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,034
for the digital nomads.

936
00:56:06,034 --> 00:56:08,058
These are the tough questions
that needed to be asked

937
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:10,039
and come up with solutions from in order

938
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:12,122
for it to be implemented.

939
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:16,024
- Visas have been such a
challenge because you look online

940
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:20,081
and the Visa information
is never up to date.

941
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:21,613
- And they change it every 6 months.

942
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:24,530
There needs to be a universal visa.

943
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:30,739
Just let me pay some money a
lot of money, I don’t care.

944
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:32,762
Give me a universal visa

945
00:56:32,762 --> 00:56:35,845
and make it easier and put it online.

946
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:38,928
- They’re here on a tourist visa

947
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,085
and they’re always doing
all these tourist visa runs,

948
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:44,305
go to the border, come
back, or some of them

949
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:48,161
they go a different route,
let’s say to get education visa.

950
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:51,369
Some of them, they go to
a Thai language school

951
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:53,822
and they’ll become a
student for Thai language

952
00:56:53,822 --> 00:56:56,261
and then they go, “We’re a student visa,”

953
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:59,094
but then they never go to classes.

954
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:03,791
I mean look if you want
to stay in Thailand,

955
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:07,294
you want to be here for
a longer period of time,

956
00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:11,137
maybe you should consider
how can you pay taxes?

957
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:14,509
If you pay taxes, that
is a direct indicator

958
00:57:14,509 --> 00:57:18,676
that you want to be a
contributing member society.

959
00:57:20,511 --> 00:57:23,832
“Please stay in my country
but you don’t pay taxes.

960
00:57:23,832 --> 00:57:25,895
"You don’t give us anything.”

961
00:57:25,895 --> 00:57:29,728
That doesn’t sound like
a good business pitch.

962
00:57:30,674 --> 00:57:32,491
There are complicated legal questions

963
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,823
when you’re dealing with tax issues,

964
00:57:34,823 --> 00:57:37,647
with immigration issues.

965
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:42,043
- The one thing that I can
say with absolute certainty is

966
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:45,737
that you do not want to
rely on the advice of people

967
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:49,078
who are not well versed and trained in

968
00:57:49,078 --> 00:57:52,407
and licensed in dealing with these issues.

969
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:55,243
I see it a lot on blogs
and in various forums

970
00:57:55,243 --> 00:58:00,163
where nomads will ask for
answers from other nomads

971
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:02,150
and that just make no sense at all.

972
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:06,705
Someone’s experience as an
individual is interesting

973
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:09,071
and illuminating but you
really want to get your answers

974
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:13,670
from somebody that is well
versed in this system.

975
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:14,917
Interesting story.

976
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:18,687
Our son is in Thailand and was dealing

977
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:22,604
with the hopping in,
hopping out visa run issue

978
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:27,356
and I said to him,
every month I would say,

979
00:58:27,356 --> 00:58:29,346
“Talk to an immigration lawyer.”

980
00:58:29,346 --> 00:58:31,452
He would say, “No, I’ve
talked to some guys,”

981
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:34,029
and I was, “Talk to an
immigration lawyer."

982
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:37,929
Finally after a year of doing
visa runs, coming and going,

983
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:40,414
he finally talked to an immigration lawyer

984
00:58:40,414 --> 00:58:42,972
and what do you know, the
immigration lawyer had answers

985
00:58:42,972 --> 00:58:46,733
to his questions and
solutions to his problems.

986
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:48,636
- There’s very low compliance and tax laws

987
00:58:48,636 --> 00:58:52,487
to begin with Indonesians
and then also foreigners.

988
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,497
A lot of foreigners are
here and they’re not clear

989
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,099
about what the tax rules are.

990
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,610
If they try to find out what
they are, it’s very confusing.

991
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,927
Most people just choose to
put their head in the sand

992
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:05,570
and ignore the regulatory environment.

993
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:07,153
I think it’s really
interesting for governments

994
00:59:07,153 --> 00:59:11,394
around the world as all
of these type of movement,

995
00:59:11,394 --> 00:59:13,225
this type of migration is happening.

996
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:16,837
You go on a holiday for two
weeks to the United States

997
00:59:16,837 --> 00:59:21,649
and you’re managing your business
in China, are you working?

998
00:59:21,649 --> 00:59:23,956
Do you need a work permit for that?

999
00:59:23,956 --> 00:59:25,986
I think probably not.

1000
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:27,106
It’s not clear.

1001
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,356
It’s not clear.

1002
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:31,826
- The government will get you eventually

1003
00:59:31,826 --> 00:59:35,993
if the numbers are high enough
for the government to care.

1004
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:38,521
You want to figure out what the laws are.

1005
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:40,726
You want to figure out who
you owe, you want to comply.

1006
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:43,818
You want to pay what you
owe and stay in compliance

1007
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:46,660
with all the applicable laws.

1008
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,679
It is better to do what
you’re supposed to do now

1009
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:51,335
rather than worry about when they’re going

1010
00:59:51,335 --> 00:59:53,152
to catch up with you later.

1011
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:56,902
- It bugs me how
unconscious a lot of people.

1012
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:02,808
I’ve heard conversations
between people where they brag

1013
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,305
about how they don’t have to pay for visas

1014
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:08,365
and they brag about how
they don’t have to pay taxes

1015
01:00:08,365 --> 01:00:09,762
and some of the places.

1016
01:00:09,762 --> 01:00:12,699
These people are living in a
country for two, three years.

1017
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:15,163
There’s starving kids all around

1018
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:18,843
and they’re bragging about
they don’t have to pay taxes

1019
01:00:18,843 --> 01:00:22,868
and they hired a maid for 50
cents an hour or whatever.

1020
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:25,989
It’s just like know where you’re living.

1021
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,835
Know what you’re participating in

1022
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:30,962
because whatever country
you choose to spend time in,

1023
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:35,895
you are participating in that
society, in those systems.

1024
01:00:35,895 --> 01:00:40,485
I do believe in the
benefits of this lifestyle

1025
01:00:40,485 --> 01:00:43,282
and I do believe in a lot
of the philosophical ideas

1026
01:00:43,282 --> 01:00:46,067
behind it but I feel like

1027
01:00:46,067 --> 01:00:49,590
there’s no ethical voice talking about it.

1028
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:50,722
- Yeah, I agree.

1029
01:00:50,722 --> 01:00:52,555
There is a bit of a problem when we look

1030
01:00:52,555 --> 01:00:55,273
at how it’s mostly the
digital nomad lifestyle

1031
01:00:55,273 --> 01:00:59,275
is a very western phenomenon
or for the rich white kids

1032
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:01,788
who can go off and travel the world

1033
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:04,497
and run an online business
and take advantage

1034
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:06,873
of all the great facilities
and the infrastructure

1035
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:08,877
and all these developing countries.

1036
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:10,524
I get that.

1037
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:14,284
That is a fertile ground for criticism.

1038
01:01:14,284 --> 01:01:16,130
That’s something we need to look at.

1039
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,658
- I see all these articles
that pushing people

1040
01:01:18,658 --> 01:01:20,160
to travel around the world.

1041
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,245
I have a friend who lives
in India and he is a nomad.

1042
01:01:24,245 --> 01:01:25,804
He wants to be a nomad,

1043
01:01:25,804 --> 01:01:27,725
but being a nomad for him
is so much more difficult

1044
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,050
than it is for me.

1045
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,010
I am an American citizen,

1046
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:33,858
and I am very fortunate to
have a very powerful passport,

1047
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:37,422
in the terms that it lets
me visit most countries

1048
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:40,709
with very flexible dates
of when I can leave.

1049
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:42,676
I can stay at one place for 90 days.

1050
01:01:42,676 --> 01:01:45,162
With him, he was only given like a week,

1051
01:01:45,162 --> 01:01:48,411
and he gets easily denied to stay longer.

1052
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:50,880
It's because the country that he is from,

1053
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,726
the passport is not
considered as powerful.

1054
01:01:54,726 --> 01:01:58,521
That just, it really sucks.

1055
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:02,085
- This is kind of the cutting
edge of what's happening now.

1056
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,519
It's a very new and exciting thing.

1057
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,770
Generally, cutting edge things
start in the richest parts

1058
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:13,945
of the world because you
have people who are educated

1059
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:16,347
and wealthy enough to
take these kinds of risks

1060
01:02:16,347 --> 01:02:17,855
and try these new things.

1061
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,857
- These great programmers

1062
01:02:18,857 --> 01:02:22,414
from all over the world come to Thailand,

1063
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:26,455
how do you transfer your
skills on to the locals?

1064
01:02:26,455 --> 01:02:29,205
How you get them excited
about programming?

1065
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:32,630
How do you mentor people so
that they learn from you?

1066
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:35,192
These are the types of people
we want to see come in here.

1067
01:02:35,192 --> 01:02:37,863
- When I came here, I hosted a NodeSchool

1068
01:02:37,863 --> 01:02:39,707
for local developers to learn Node.

1069
01:02:39,707 --> 01:02:42,140
Some people came and if they can learn how

1070
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,778
to make their own technical stuff,

1071
01:02:43,778 --> 01:02:45,855
then I’m not needed anymore to be here.

1072
01:02:45,855 --> 01:02:46,704
That’s really helpful.

1073
01:02:46,704 --> 01:02:49,287
It’s also like I’m
trying to build a website

1074
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:51,130
for a taxi driver here
because I feel like I want

1075
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,332
to help them out.

1076
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:55,535
There’s different ways of
ameliorating the problem

1077
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:57,103
of just being a guy who comes in,

1078
01:02:57,103 --> 01:02:59,520
spends some money and leaves.

1079
01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:03,982
As long as we’re cognizant
of that, I feel better.

1080
01:03:03,982 --> 01:03:06,612
- Digital nomads can be professional,

1081
01:03:06,612 --> 01:03:08,184
they can be remote-working,

1082
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,439
they can be building
million dollar products,

1083
01:03:10,439 --> 01:03:12,503
they can be working on distributed teams

1084
01:03:12,503 --> 01:03:16,131
on unicorn start-ups across the world,

1085
01:03:16,131 --> 01:03:20,637
they can be some of the most
amazing people to talk to.

1086
01:03:20,637 --> 01:03:24,231
- Let’s look at a world
where Star Trek existed,

1087
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:26,201
the federation of planets and what not.

1088
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:27,406
You didn’t have borders.

1089
01:03:27,406 --> 01:03:29,117
They didn’t have nationalities.

1090
01:03:29,117 --> 01:03:31,282
They were Earth.

1091
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:33,510
They just existed and
they all lived in peace

1092
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,102
and they just went everywhere.

1093
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:39,123
If the world is going to
move in that direction,

1094
01:03:39,123 --> 01:03:40,156
what Gene Roddenberry imagined

1095
01:03:40,156 --> 01:03:45,923
way, way back in the ‘60s,
the digital nomad lifestyle

1096
01:03:45,952 --> 01:03:48,799
is one pathway that we can get there.

1097
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,466
It’s pretty awesome.

1183
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:02,937
- If you think about this

1184
01:04:02,937 --> 01:04:04,340
from the businessman point of view,

1185
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,555
I mean what are your options.

1186
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:08,697
If you want to get more
having more profit,

1187
01:04:08,697 --> 01:04:10,771
you most probably need more customers.

1188
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:13,271
(light music)

1189
01:04:17,862 --> 01:04:19,743
We have 1.3 million Estonians,

1190
01:04:19,743 --> 01:04:23,910
and what are our ways to
increase our customer base?

1191
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:27,449
We basically need more people.

1192
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:29,276
If you don’t have those services

1193
01:04:29,276 --> 01:04:32,016
that you need in your country available,

1194
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:35,636
but those service are available
location independently

1195
01:04:35,636 --> 01:04:37,636
from another country.

1196
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:41,966
That’s where the e-residency
concept comes from.

1197
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:44,466
(light music)

1198
01:05:00,224 --> 01:05:02,890
- After 20 hours of this launch page,

1199
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,900
we received over 4,000 early subscribers

1200
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,122
who want to become e-residents
from 150 different countries.

1201
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,981
It totally spread, word
of mouth, just tweets.

1202
01:05:11,981 --> 01:05:14,564
It was amazing.

1203
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:17,936
All together this package, this company,

1204
01:05:17,936 --> 01:05:20,506
bank account, service provider,
digital signature means

1205
01:05:20,506 --> 01:05:24,116
that you can run location
independent business.

1206
01:05:24,116 --> 01:05:26,978
The e-Estonia showroom gets
three delegations per day

1207
01:05:26,978 --> 01:05:29,198
for that reason, because
Estonia has been successful

1208
01:05:29,198 --> 01:05:31,359
in all e-Estonia solutions.

1209
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,330
We are helping to help other countries

1210
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,673
to also implement those platforms

1211
01:05:35,673 --> 01:05:37,645
and get those services there.

1212
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:38,818
Estonia also benefits.

1213
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:41,472
If everybody, every
country would be so digital

1214
01:05:41,472 --> 01:05:43,115
and then you could start communicating

1215
01:05:43,115 --> 01:05:44,825
with each other very easily.

1216
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:47,453
For example, send e-tax
reports automatically

1217
01:05:47,453 --> 01:05:48,419
between every country

1218
01:05:48,419 --> 01:05:50,715
and everybody would pay
taxes automatically,

1219
01:05:50,715 --> 01:05:51,942
everything would be great here.

1220
01:05:51,942 --> 01:05:53,797
It would be everybody's benefit

1221
01:05:53,797 --> 01:05:57,063
that more countries
would be more flexible,

1222
01:05:57,063 --> 01:05:59,646
more innovative in that sense.

1223
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:04,143
- How to get more foreign
investment, how to get best talents.

1224
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:08,310
Estonia, we have found our
way to compete in this war

1225
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:12,670
and providing best
services to the citizens

1226
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:16,040
and most convenient and
affordable services.

1098
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,724
- E-residency program
are emblematic concerns

1099
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:20,514
where governments are going to be going

1100
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:24,722
in the next maybe not five
years but 10, 20 years

1101
01:06:24,722 --> 01:06:26,469
because what they’re trying
to do is they’re trying

1102
01:06:26,469 --> 01:06:28,276
to compete for the kind of folks

1103
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,718
who are likely start businesses,

1104
01:06:29,718 --> 01:06:32,275
bring wealth and jobs and
so on to their society.

1105
01:06:32,275 --> 01:06:34,587
This is actually putting
governments into competition

1106
01:06:34,587 --> 01:06:36,221
with each other in a new way.

1107
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:38,304
There is a really important paradigm shift

1108
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:40,335
as you move from the
government to a government.

1109
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:43,028
It seems to move from
the company to a company.

1110
01:06:43,028 --> 01:06:46,787
Once you are mobile, a
government is just a provider

1111
01:06:46,787 --> 01:06:49,801
of natural resources rule sets.

1112
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,973
Cultural things that date to the fact

1113
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:55,633
that it used to be a geographical entity.

1114
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:56,878
More and more people will move.

1115
01:06:56,878 --> 01:06:58,121
They’ll pick the government
that suits them best

1116
01:06:58,121 --> 01:06:59,219
at this particular time and place.

1117
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:02,349
It means they'll move later in life.

1118
01:07:33,445 --> 01:07:34,866
- We're still learning about the best way

1119
01:07:34,866 --> 01:07:38,114
to set up global work
forces and things like that.

1120
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:41,281
I think if you get some big successes,

1121
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,881
people will start to, you know.

1122
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:45,714
Companies who may have
thought that the only way

1123
01:07:45,714 --> 01:07:48,196
to run an organization was
with a giant headquarters

1124
01:07:48,196 --> 01:07:49,733
in one location and might start

1125
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,170
to think there's different ways

1126
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:55,003
to do things and experiment
a little bit more.

1127
01:07:56,811 --> 01:08:00,269
- More and more companies they
do realize they need to adapt

1128
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:03,070
and they need to be more innovative

1129
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:06,008
and make their employees happier

1130
01:08:06,008 --> 01:08:08,341
by giving them more freedom.

1131
01:08:09,558 --> 01:08:12,370
- The fact is people want to
work in more flexible ways,

1132
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:13,993
in different ways than
they've been working

1133
01:08:13,993 --> 01:08:18,737
for the last 10, 20, 40, 100 years.

1134
01:08:18,737 --> 01:08:20,670
Ever since the industrial revolution.

1135
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:23,902
This idea of working in
these massive offices

1136
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:27,957
in a corporate environment
is no longer appealing

1137
01:08:27,957 --> 01:08:29,558
to many, many people.

1138
01:08:29,558 --> 01:08:33,036
I think digital nomads might
be the extreme example,

1139
01:08:33,036 --> 01:08:36,487
but they're an example of
how the world is changing.

1140
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,480
- The world is going to
get a lot more remote

1141
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,558
for various reasons.

1142
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:42,423
We have good enough technology

1143
01:08:42,423 --> 01:08:46,109
that people can stay
in touch all the time.

1144
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:49,757
Society in general is just
more excited about travel,

1145
01:08:49,757 --> 01:08:54,394
excited about seeing new
places, visiting new places.

1146
01:08:54,394 --> 01:08:57,442
- I think people might
assume the place they grow up

1147
01:08:57,442 --> 01:08:59,864
is where they should be.

1148
01:08:59,864 --> 01:09:02,470
You might be a lot happier somewhere else.

1149
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,126
If you go and explore
and try other places,

1150
01:09:05,126 --> 01:09:06,130
you might find somewhere

1151
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:08,342
where it just feels like a much better fit

1152
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:10,152
for you as a person.

1153
01:09:10,152 --> 01:09:11,374
Who's to say that the place

1154
01:09:11,374 --> 01:09:16,291
that you grew up is the place
that you're meant to be?
